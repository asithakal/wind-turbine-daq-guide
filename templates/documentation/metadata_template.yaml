description: |

  This dataset contains six months of continuous measurements (June-December 2025) 

  from a 500W helical vertical-axis wind turbine deployed at the University of 

  Moratuwa coastal test site in Sri Lanka. Data was collected at 1 Hz sampling 

  frequency using a custom ESP32-based data acquisition system. 

  

  Measured parameters include:

  - Wind speed at hub height (3.5 m above ground)

  - Rotor rotational speed (RPM)

  - Electrical power output (DC)

  - Ambient temperature, barometric pressure, and relative humidity

  - Calculated air density, tip speed ratio (λ), and power coefficient (Cp)

  

  The primary objective is to characterize turbine aerodynamic performance 

  (Cp-λ curve) under tropical coastal conditions with high humidity (75-95% RH) 

  and salt spray exposure. Data quality: 92.3% completeness; measurement 

  uncertainties documented in accompanying technical report.

  

  This dataset supports reproducible research and provides empirical validation 

  for small-scale wind turbine performance models in developing-region contexts.
